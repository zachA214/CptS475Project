## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading data}
dataset = read.csv("Phishing-or-Safe-Sheet1.csv")
```

```{r data frame making}
#Taking the first 6 trials, since they are the ones with the emails made by the LLM
for_graph = dataset %>% select(trial, success)
summ = for_graph %>% 
  group_by(trial) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(success) / 10)
print(summ)
#The final three trials were when we tested the model with data directly from the training dataset to see how accurate it became, so when graphing, we will omit those.
#summ = summ[1:6,]
```


```{R graph}
ggplot(summ, aes(x = trial, y = total)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Success per Trial", x = "Trial", y = "Success Rate")
```

```{R freq table}
emails = dataset %>% filter(expected.result == "Phishing")
emails = emails %>% select(email.contents)
tokenized = emails %>% unnest_tokens(word, email.contents)
freq = tokenized %>% count(word, sort = TRUE)
print(freq)
freq = head(freq, 10)
ggplot(freq, aes(x = reorder(word, -n), y = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Word Frequency", x = "Words", y = "Frequency") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
